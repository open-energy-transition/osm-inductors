# osm-wikidata-toolset
This repository contains a set of tools to extract, transform and analyze wikidata electricity infrastructure information and asses its potential integration to Open Street Map.

Currently, the repository contains the following python scripts and folders :

  1. **compare_osm_wikidata_powerplants.py**, which is an in depth OSM vs wikidata powerplant matching script.
  2. **fetch_wiki_info_by_country.py**, which fetches classes and subclasses of any Qid that can be found in wikidata. To search and find a Qid, modify them accordingly in the config.yaml file. There is two version of the file. The first one is recommended for one Qid search at the time and the v2 is a faster version recommended if there is need to search for a batch of Qid as it is based on parallel search.
  3. **get_wiki_substations.py**, which fetches classes and subclasses of substations in wikidata to generate a new dataset grouped by country. (First version of the fetching script, for more accurate results use "fetch_wiki_info_by_country").
  4. An **"output_by_qid"** folder that has all the obtained data and csv files generated by country and Qid code.


## OSM vs Wikidata Power Plant Comparison

This Python script compares power plant data between **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** and **Wikidata**. It fetches data from both sources using APIs, performs comparisons based on geographic proximity and name, and identifies missing power plants or coordinate mismatches. The comparison results are saved in **CSV** and **GeoJSON** formats.

### Features
- Fetches power plant data from Wikidata using the SPARQL API.
- Fetches power plant data from OpenStreetMap using the Overpass API.
- Compares the datasets based on geographic proximity and name matching.
- Identifies missing power plants and coordinate mismatches between OSM and Wikidata.
- Outputs the comparison results in CSV files, geoJSON file for missing data in OSM and quickstatement file for missing data in wikidata

### CSV Files Output
The script generates the following CSV files containing valuable matched/unmatched data:
- **`wikidataset.csv`**: Contains the power plants fetched from Wikidata.
- **`osm_api_dataset.csv`**: Contains the power plants fetched from OpenStreetMap.
- **Comparison Results CSV Files**:
  - **`missing_in_wikidata.csv`**: Lists power plants missing in Wikidata but found in OSM.
  - **`coordinate_mismatches_missing_wikidata.csv`**: Lists coordinate mismatches in Wikidata.
  - **`wikidata_missing_coordinate.csv`**: Lists Wikidata entries missing coordinates.
  - **`missing_in_osm.csv`**: Lists power plants missing in OpenStreetMap but found in wikidata.
  - **`coordinate_mismatches_missing_osm.csv`**: Lists coordinate mismatches in the missing data from OpenStreetMap.
  - **`missing_in_osm.geojson`**: GeoJSON file composed of missing powerplants in OSM. 
  - **`missing_in_wikidata.qs`**: Quickstatement file with missing powerplant data in wikidata

## Wikidata Infrastructure Fetch Script
This script fetches and organizes infrastructure-related entities from Wikidata by country and infrastructure type (e.g., power plants, substations, transmission lines). It uses SPARQL queries to extract metadata and geographic coordinates for each entity, grouped by country and tagged with the relevant QIDs.

### Key Features

- **Configurable via `config.yaml`**  
  Define infrastructure QIDs, SPARQL endpoint, and user agent.

- **Country-Level Summaries**  
  Retrieves and saves entity counts by country (`*_counts_by_country.csv`).

- **Detailed Entity Fetching**  
  Collects item-level data per country, including coordinates and labels.

- **GeoJSON Output**  
  Generates per-country `.geojson` files for easy import into GIS or OpenStreetMap tools like JOSM.

- **Caching for Speed**  
  Speeds up repeated runs using a local `cache/` folder. Caching can be disabled via `reset_cache` in the config.

- **Duplicate Handling**  
  Filters out duplicate Wikidata entities based on their unique ID (`entity` URL).

### Output Structure

All output files are organized by QID in either `output_by_qid/` or `output_by_qid_V2/`  folder:

## Wikidata Power Substation Extraction

This Python script extracts and organizes power substation data from Wikidata. It fetches substation data by country using the SPARQL API, classifies substations by verified types (e.g., electrical substations, HVDC converter stations), and outputs the results in CSV and GeoJSON formats.

### Features

- Fetches substation data from Wikidata using the SPARQL API.
- Counts and groups substations by country and type.
- Retrieves detailed substation information including geographic coordinates, type, and label.
- Splits the dataset into entries with and without geographic coordinates.
- Exports:
  - Full substation dataset in CSV format.
  - Separate CSV files for substations with and without coordinates.
  - One GeoJSON file per country containing substations with valid coordinates.

### CSV Files Output

- **`groupedbycountry.csv`**: Lists the total number of substations per country, along with associated types.
- **`wikidata_substations_full.csv`**: Contains all fetched substations including those without coordinates.
- **`wikidata_substations_with_coordinates.csv`**: Contains substations with valid latitude and longitude data.
- **`wikidata_substations_without_coordinates.csv`**: Contains substations missing coordinate information.

### GeoJSON Output

- One GeoJSON file per country is generated inside the geojson_by_country/ directory.
- Each GeoJSON file contains substations with geographic coordinates, suitable to be used as a hint layer for mapping or GIS applications.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Packages: `requests`, `pandas`, `pyyaml`

You can install all dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To run the script, use the following command: python compare_osm_wikidata_powerplants.py.py or python get_wiki_substations.py
